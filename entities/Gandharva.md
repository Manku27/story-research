    1. Narad
        -> friends-rivals with Tumburu
    2. Tumburu
        -> prime -> king of gandharva, once cursed during ramayan, holds slight grudge against kubera but still works for them.
    3. Chitrangada
        -> warrior / kingish
    4. Drumila
        -> biological father of kansa, potentially our gandharva; story to be over-correcting himself due to feeling guilty.
    5. Chitrasena
        -> captured duryodhana once
    ~ 6. Chitrangada
        -> has a thing about names, 2 people of equal caliber cannot have the same names. Might not use this. ~
